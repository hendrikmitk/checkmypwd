# checkmypwd

A simple app that checks a password for common security features.

## Description

One of my first projects was a password validator. It wasn't quite good practise, so I decided to do a rebuild. It's built with simple HTML, Tailwind CSS and Vanilla JS. Javascript and CSS parts are inline.
