# checkmypwd

checkmypwd is a simple app that checks a password for common security features. It is built with simple HTML, CSS/Sass and Vanilla JavaScript.

## Description

One of my first projects has been a password validator. It wasn't quite good practise, so I decided to do a quick rebuild. I tried to keep especially the javascript as simple as possible. Also checkmypwd uses parcel as a web application bundler

One of my first projects was a password validator. It was full of bad practice, so I decided to do a quick rebuild. I tried to keep especially the javascript as simple as possible. Also checkmypwd now uses parcel as web application bundler to keep the compiled files small.

checkmypwd is not hosted anywhere yet.
