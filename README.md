# checkmypwd

checkmypwd is a simple app that checks a password for common security features. It is built with simple HTML, CSS/Sass and Vanilla JavaScript.

## Description

One of my first projects has been a password validator. It wasn't quite good practise, so I decided to do a quick rebuild. Javascript and CSS parts are simply written inline. Also checkmypwd uses parcel as a web application bundler to keep the compiled HTML file even smaller.

checkmypwd is not hosted anywhere yet.
